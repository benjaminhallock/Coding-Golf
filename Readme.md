Coding Golf 9-course
============

Coding GOlf is a 9-course challenge to build an app for almost all languages that completes the following challenges in order, triggering the next like dominos. The challanges range from simple math caculations to animationg UI components. The instructions are attached under this description and in the RTF file. THe project is a cheat sheet.

# Hole 1

Enumerate from 0 to 100,000. If the number is equal to the year of your birth times the day of your birth, start another enumeration counting down to 0, from that number. When you hit the month your birth, break both enumerations and print "done".

# Hole 2

Make a random 6 digit number. Randomize it twice again. Divide it by two until the number is less than or equal to 26. Take this new number and determine the letter in the alphabet it represents. Print the letter. (Make sure 3=c 4=d, etc) Run the program until you spell a word.

# Hole 3

Turn the background red. Flip a coin. Make a circle that’s 10,10 in size, and start it at roughly 5,30 on screen. Color it black or white based on the coin. add it to the screen, then make another with a slight delay between each circle being added (flipping to coin each time). Repeat horizontally until you get to the edge of the screen. Start a new line. Make sure the spacing is even. Fill the screen with circles (none hanging off-screen). Once complete, animate each circle to fade to the color green & transparent over a random amount of time below 10 seconds. remove all circles.

# Hole 4

You find a dollar worth the value of Pi. You invest that dollar into a savings account. Each year, it doubles it’s value, compounded annually. If you do this for the amount of time that you have been alive, how much money do you have (rounded to the nearest dollar)? If you invest that money by feeding 3 meals @ $4/meal per day, how many kids can you feed in a year? Print "I can feed 'x' of kids".

# Hole 5

Flip a coin until you get at least 5 heads in a row. For each heads, print the word “heads”. Then print the total number of flips it took. If the program gets it in less than 10 flips, go to next hole, else restart.

# Hole 6

Make a random number between 0-10. If it’s 1 2 3, restart. If it’s 4 or 5, print “fizz”, if it’s 6-9 then go to next hole, if it’s 10, print "drinks are on me". Zero should restart.

# Hole 7 

Create an array of 10 random numbers under 1000, sort the array from smallest to biggest. 
Print out the ordered array. 

# Hole 8 

Make a string "The quick brown fox jumps swiftly jumps over the log" Separate each word into an array. Shuffle the array. Print out the new array as a string.

# Hole 9
Make a random 5 digit number. Determine if it is a prime number. Restart until you find a prime number. BONUS: Print all the prime numbers under 1 million.
